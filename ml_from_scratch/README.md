# ML From Scratch

We aim to explore some state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, svm, neural networks, decision trees) and implement them from scratch using two of the most powerful scientific libraries (i.e. **<span style='color: red;'>Numpy</span>** and **<span style='color: red;'>Scipy</span>**) . Our approach involves:

- Defining cost functions
- Implementing optimization algorithms (e.g., Gradient Descent)
- Leveraging vectorization for efficient computations
- Applying regularization techniques (e.g., to prevent overfitting)
- Assessing model performance
- Hyperparameters tuning (e.g., find subset of parameters that lead to the best performances)
- Creating specific visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms)
